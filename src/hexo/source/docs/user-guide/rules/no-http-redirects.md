# Avoid HTTP redirects in requests (`no-http-redirects`)

`no-http-redirects` checks if there are any HTTP redirects in the page
`sonarwhal` is analyzing.

## Why is this important?

The following is a simplify version of what happens when the user
requests a URL in a browser:

1. DNS Lookup: Translate the domain to an IP. If the browser doesn’t
   know it, it has to ask a DNS server which in some cases involves
   multiple queries until the final IP is obtained.
1. Open a [TCP connection][wikipedia-tcp-establishement] to the IP
   address requesting the URL.
1. The server responds to that request by sending some content over
   the TCP connection.
   If the resource uses SSL, then [TLS negotation(s)][wikipedia-tls-handshake]
   happen as well.

When a redirect happens, `3.` contains the new URL the browser needs to
request, so the whole sequence is repeated. DNS Lookup isn’t cheap,
neither is [creating a TCP connection][tcp-connection-diagram]. The
impact of redirects is even more on mobile users, where the [network
latency is usually higher][pagespeed-insights].
As a rule of thumb, the more you can avoid redirects the better.

## What does the rule check?

This rule checks:

* If the target URL passed to `sonarwhal` has any redirect. E.g.:
  `http://www.example.com` --> `http://example.com`
* If any resource in the page has any redirect. E.g.:
  `http://example.com/script.js` --> `https://example.com/script.js`

and alerts if at least one is found.

### Examples that **trigger** the rule

* Any URL passed to `sonarwhal` that redirects to another one
* Any page with a resource (script, css, image) behind a redirect

### Examples that **pass** the rule

* No redirect for resources nor the target URL.

## Can the rule be configured?

By default no redirects are allowed but you can change this behavior.

The following configuration will allow 3 redirects for resources and
1 for the main URL:

```json
{
    "no-http-redirects": ["error", {
        "max-resource-redirects": 3,
        "max-target-redirects": 1
    }]
}
```
